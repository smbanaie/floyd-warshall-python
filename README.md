The Floyd–Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights.

Print the pair, the distance and (optionally) the path.

Example

pair     dist    path
1 -> 2    -1     1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2
1 -> 3    -2     1 -> 3
1 -> 4     0     1 -> 3 -> 4
2 -> 1     4     2 -> 1
2 -> 3     2     2 -> 1 -> 3
2 -> 4     4     2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4
3 -> 1     5     3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
3 -> 2     1     3 -> 4 -> 2
3 -> 4     2     3 -> 4
4 -> 1     3     4 -> 2 -> 1
4 -> 2    -1     4 -> 2
4 -> 3     1     4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3
